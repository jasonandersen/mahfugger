     * Don't take the easy way out and change the CSV file. Sort those bitches.
     *
     * In the Track class constructor, you need to load the track points into a member variable. However, you
     * can't assume that they are in the right order when they get passed in so you'll need to sort them. 
     * If you make the TrackPoint class implement the Comparable<TrackPoint> interface, you can setup TrackPoint 
     * objects so they naturally sort by timestamp. Then you can just add all the TrackPoint instances
     * to a SortedSet implementation and you will inherently get a sorted collection.
