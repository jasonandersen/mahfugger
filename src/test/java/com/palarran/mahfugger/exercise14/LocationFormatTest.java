     * LocationFormat is an enum that represents the only possible location formatting options
     * for a Location class. Enum are objects however and they can contain both data and behavior.
     * Each enumeration in an enum class is it's own instance of that class. So for LocationFormat,
     * we're using the different instances to contain the algorithm for the formatting. This is a
     * clean way to house Location formatting code in one spot without kludgy if/else blocks or 
     * select blocks.
