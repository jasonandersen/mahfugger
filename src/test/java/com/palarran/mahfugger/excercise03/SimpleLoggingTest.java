 * System.out.println(), you should almost always use a log message instead.

     * This is a log4j Logger instance. All logging commands will go through this object.

     * you can see what class generated the log message. In order to setup the Logger for
     * this class, we use the Logger.getLogger() static method and pass in this class.
     * 
     * We always instantiate Logger objects as private static. If we didn't use static, we'd
     * have a new Logger instance for every instance of this class. We only want one instance 
     * of this logger regardless of how many instances of SimpleLoggingTest get created.
     * 
     * Whenever you create an instance of a Logger, make sure that the class you are passing
     * in to the getLogger method is the current class. Putting the wrong class name into the
     * getLogger method will make problem sovling collosally more difficult. AMHIK.

    /*
     * log levels
     * 
     * Logging can be done at several levels. Each level tells the logging framework the criticality
     * of the particular log message. This way, you can control how many log messages actually 
     * get written. Sometimes you want every single last log message. Sometimes you only want to
     * know the important messages. I've seen whole servers brought down to their knees because an
     * admin left the log level on DEBUG and the server was writing a firehose of log messages.
     * 
     * DEBUG - use this level for most of your log messages. Especially if you're trying to trace
     *         execution through a stack trace or you want to dump the value of variables out while
     *         you're executing.
     *         
     * INFO  - I use this when interesting things happen. When I start up services or instantiate 
     *         important application-wide objects. Most of the time, production code should be logging
     *         at an INFO level so I put things in here that are good to know while the application
     *         is running in production.
     *         
     * WARN  - something happened and it wasn't good. It wasn't catastrophic but we are no longer at
     *         DEFCON PUPPIES & RAINBOWS
     *         
     * ERROR - shit is going down. This level of message is almost always accompanied by some
     *         kind of exception object to at least let us know what kind of shit is going down.
